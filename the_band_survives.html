    <h1>The Band Survives</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-style: italic; color: #c4956c;">A Paleolithic Survival Story</p>
    
    <p>For over 100,000 years, humans lived in small bands of 15-30 people, moving with the seasons, reading the land, and surviving through cooperation, knowledge, and ingenuity.</p>
    
    <p>You are about to experience one critical autumn and winter in the life of such a band. Your decisions—and those of your companions—will determine whether your people survive to see spring.</p>
    
    <p>This is not a story of "primitive" people struggling in ignorance. It is a story of sophisticated knowledge, careful observation, complex social bonds, and the remarkable adaptability that allowed our ancestors to thrive in environments from grasslands to tundra.</p>
    
    <div class="insight">
        <strong>Archaeological Note:</strong> Evidence from sites across Europe, Africa, and Asia reveals that Paleolithic peoples developed complex tools, created art, cared for their injured and elderly, and maintained oral traditions that could preserve knowledge across generations. Their survival depended on cooperation, expertise, and environmental wisdom that took lifetimes to master.
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>Your choices will reveal the sophistication of Paleolithic life.</strong></p>
    
    <h2 style="margin-top: 30px; color: #d4a574;">Choose Your Experience</h2>
    
    <div class="choice" onclick="selectDifficulty('story')">
        <strong>📖 Story Mode - Focus on Learning</strong><br>
        Higher success rates on risky choices (75-85%). Failures are rare. Best for first playthrough or focusing on Paleolithic life content without frustration. Recommended for understanding the historical context.
    </div>
    
    <div class="choice" onclick="selectDifficulty('normal')">
        <strong>⚖️ Normal Mode - Balanced Challenge</strong><br>
        Standard success rates (55-75%). Realistic uncertainty with meaningful consequences. Experience both success and failure. Best for understanding the precarity and adaptability of Paleolithic life. <em>(Default recommended)</em>
    </div>
    
    <div class="choice" onclick="selectDifficulty('challenge')">
        <strong>💀 Challenge Mode - Test Your Strategy</strong><br>
        Lower success rates (45-65%). High risk, frequent setbacks. Only for those who want to test optimal decision-making under extreme pressure. Shows why most Paleolithic bands didn't survive.

        <p><em>Perspective: You understand seasonal cycles, plant processing, preservation, and the steady work that ensures survival.</em></p>

        <p><em>Perspective: You see materials, techniques, and innovations. Every problem is a challenge to solve through better tools.</em></p>

        <p><em>Perspective: You see patterns across time, understand consequences, and know that wisdom is the band's most precious resource.</em></p>

    <p>You wake to excited whispers. Tarak, the lead tracker, has found mammoth signs near the northern ridge—fresh dung, broken branches at shoulder height. The herd passed through yesterday.</p>
    
    <p>But there's tension. Mira spent two days locating a grove of ripe hazelnuts three valleys south. The nuts will fall within days, and gathering them requires most of the band. Autumn is short; winter comes fast to these mountains.</p>
    
    <p>Korin pulls you aside: "My best spear points are finished, but I need sinew to attach them properly. Fresh kill provides that. But..." he glances at the old dried meat hanging in camp, "...we could survive winter on nuts, fish, and stored meat if we're careful."</p>

        <strong>Advocate for the mammoth hunt</strong><br>

            <strong>Archaeological Evidence:</strong> Paleolithic peoples hunted mammoth using sophisticated cooperative techniques—driving prey toward natural obstacles, using atlatls (spear-throwers) for range, and coordinating multiple hunters. Sites show complete butchering with no waste. However, hunts were dangerous and uncertain. Plant foods, especially nuts, provided reliable calories and could be stored. Successful bands balanced risk and reliability.

    <p>One evening, Korin sits by the fire working on a new hafting technique. He's trying to attach a stone point to a wooden shaft using a combination of pine resin, sinew, and a new wrapping pattern he observed from a neighboring band two seasons ago.</p>
    
    <p>"The old way works," he mutters, "but this...if I can get it right, the point won't come loose even in bone. The leverage would be better too." He's been working on this for days, using precious materials.</p>
    
    <p>Tarak watches skeptically. "We have spears that work. Why waste time and sinew on experiments?"</p>
    
    <p>But you've noticed Korin's innovations before. Some failed, but others—like his method for heat-treating stone to improve flaking—changed how your band makes tools.</p>

            <strong>Archaeological Evidence:</strong> Early winters or unusual weather presented existential challenges to Paleolithic peoples. Successful bands needed mobility (ability to move when necessary), flexibility (adapt shelter to conditions), and environmental knowledge (know where protected camps existed). Cave sites across Europe show repeated occupation across millennia, suggesting humans remembered and returned to the best winter locations. Rapid adaptation to changing conditions was essential for survival.

                    <p>You argue for something different: "Winter isn't just about surviving—it's about maintaining who we are. About teaching the next generation. About becoming better at our crafts."</p>
                    
                    <p>The band embraces this philosophy. Elders teach children about plants, animals, seasons, navigation. Korin holds tool-making sessions, passing on techniques. ${gameState.toldStory ? 'You continue storytelling traditions, making them richer.' : 'Stories are told every evening—old ones remembered, new ones created.'}</p>
                    
                    <p>Hunters practice tracking theory, discussing past hunts. Gatherers share processing knowledge. People work on crafts—better baskets, improved clothing, decorative items using ochre ${gameState.tradedWithNeighbors ? 'from the River Band' : 'saved from previous seasons'}.</p>
                    
                    <p>Food is rationed, but spirits remain surprisingly high. People are engaged, learning, creating. Children will remember this winter not as suffering, but as the time they learned their people's knowledge.</p>
                    
                    <p>By spring, you're thinner, but your band is more skilled, more united, and carries more knowledge than before.</p>

            <strong>Archaeological Evidence:</strong> Winter was a crucial time for knowledge transmission in Paleolithic societies. With limited outdoor activity, people spent long hours in close quarters. This time was used for teaching tool-making, telling stories that encoded survival information, planning future seasons, and strengthening social bonds. Archaeological sites show evidence of winter craft production—tools made during cold months when hunting and gathering were limited. Successful bands didn't just survive winter—they used it productively.

        <div class="insight">
            <p>The Paleolithic period lasted over 2.5 million years—more than 99% of human history. Our ancestors survived ice ages, volcanic winters, droughts, and countless challenges through:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cooperation:</strong> Small bands working together, sharing resources, making collective decisions</li>
                <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Constantly improving tools, techniques, and strategies</li>
                <li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Accumulating and preserving understanding through oral tradition</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptation:</strong> Responding flexibly to changing conditions</li>
                <li><strong>Social bonds:</strong> Building networks across bands, helping each other</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These weren't "primitive" people struggling in ignorance. They were sophisticated, skilled, thoughtful humans who understood their environment deeply and survived through intelligence, cooperation, and cultural knowledge that took thousands of generations to accumulate.</p>
            
            <p>You've experienced just one autumn and winter. Your ancestors did this for over 100,000 years.</p>
